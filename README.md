Background:
An intersection of friendly competition and entertainment, Without A Trace is a proposed solution to the environmental literacy issue in Santa Cruz schools. Without A Trace is a multimedia smartphone game that is designed to educate smartphone users on environmentally-responsible materials management practices. The game simulates real-world situations in which citizens must store, sort, recover, and conserve used materials. By creating varying conditions and circumstances, the levels will test playersâ€™ critical thinking skills and environmental choices in a harmless, yet memorable, way.
